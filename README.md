# METROCAR Project - Funnel Analysis 

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization.
We will use SQL for data collection and Pandas for further analysis and visualisation.
The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel.

## Metrocarâ€™s Funnel

The customer funnel for Metrocar includes the following stages:

1. App Download: A user downloads the Metrocar app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Signup: The user creates an account in the Metrocar app, including their name, email, phone number, and payment information.
3. Request Ride: The user opens the app and requests a ride by entering their pickup location, destination, and ride capacity (2 to 6 riders).
4. Driver Acceptance: A nearby driver receives the ride request and accepts the ride.
5. Ride: The driver arrives at the pickup location, and the user gets in the car and rides to their destination.
6. Payment: After the ride, the user is charged automatically through the app, and a receipt is sent to their email.
7. Review: The user is prompted to rate their driver and leave a review of their ride experience.

## Business questions

You will need to analyze the data and make recommendations based on the following business questions:

- What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
- Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
- What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
- Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
- What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?
